# Fourier-visualizer
Finds the Fourier series of a function and plots it before and after.
## Files
* main.py
* modules.py
## Plans
Converting to a more useable filetype (.exe, etc.) for convenience
## Instructions
Download either the all in one program or both modules and main.
Simply input the function you wish to find a Fourier series for (** and ^ for powers can both be used), and follow the prompts for bounds and number of terms in the series.
The program will save the graph in the folder the program is running in by default, but can be save to a sub folder if specified.
