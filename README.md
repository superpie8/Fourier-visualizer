Finds the Fourier series of a function and plots it before and after.
## Files
* main.py
* modules.py
## Plans
Converting to a more useable filetype (.exe, etc.) for convenience
## Instructions
Simply input the function you wish to find a Fourier series for (** and ^ for powers can both be used), and follow the prompts for bounds and number of terms in the series.
